**Default Parameters**  
PAGE_SIZE = 28   
BUFFER_SIZE = 40   

In final evaluation we can change these parameters to test your code, also make sure your code work for very large testcases too.  
 
 ## TC_search    
Test case for linear search and binary search       
**sorted_input** - Binary file containing Sorted integers   
**query_search.txt** - File containing integers which need to search in sorted_input file    
**output_Search.txt** - Contain search output  

 
 ## TC_delete 
 Test case for deletion   
 **sorted_input** - Binary file containing Sorted integers  
 **query_insert.txt** - File containing integers which need to delete in sorted_input file        
 **output_delete** - Binary File after completing all deletions given in query_insert.txt   
 
 
## TC_join1
Test case for join 1  
**input1_join** - Binary file containing integers  
**input2_join** - Binary file containing integers   
**outfile_join1** - Output binary file containing integers after join


## TC_join2 
Test case for join 2  
**input1_join** - Binary file containing integers  
**input2_join** - Binary file containing  sorted integers  
**outfile_join2** - Output binary file containing integers after join

*Note*:- In join algorithms, for sample test cases we consider BUFFER_SIZE =3 also order of integers in output file can be different.
